Our entry for DevCup 2014.

Data doesn't have to look crappy or boring. Sometimes you need it to look good to understand it. A lot of times, by putting two unrelated or semi-related queries you find a connection you never saw before.

TruSight is a data visualization platform for Keen.io that displays charts, graphs and stats on a fluid grid using gridster created with Python's flask microframework. It takes in a JSON file that is uploaded to Keen.io's servers as events. It comes with a built-in query generator that creates your charts and graphs asynchronously. You can move these around and re-order them as you see fit.

It looks clean and simple and is lightweight thanks to YUI's Pure.css. 

At heart, it's a mish-mash of available plugins and libraries. We didn't re-invent the wheel, but took other people's tools and made something nice.

It's at its infancy since it was made for a ~24 hr hackathon. It needs cleaning up and a more structured way of calling it which will come in time.
